# DESCRIPTION 
Given two integer variables a and b, and a boolean variable flag. The task is to check the status and return accordingly.

Return True for the following cases:

Either a or b (not both) is non-negative and the flag is false.
Both a and b are negative and the flag is true.
Otherwise, return False.

Examples: 

Input: a = 1, b = -1, flag = False
Output: True
Explanation: Since a is positive, b is negative, and flag is False, condition 1 holds true, so the function returns True.

## SOLUTION 
class Solution:
    def checkStatus(self, a, b, flag):
        # code here
        if not flag:
            return (a >= 0 and b < 0) or (a < 0 and b >= 0)
        else :
            return (a < 0 and b < 0)
