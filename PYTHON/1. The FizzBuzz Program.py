## DESCRIPTION 
Given a number n, print your answer according to the following conditions:

If the number is divisible by 3, you print Fizz
If the number is divisible by 5, you print Buzz
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print FizzBuzz
In any other case, you print the number itself
Examples:

Input: n = 3
Output: Fizz
Explanation: Here, the number is divisible by 3, so Fizz is printed.

## SOLUTION 
n = int(input())

if n % 3 == 0 and n % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
elif n % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
elif n % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
else:
    print(n)
