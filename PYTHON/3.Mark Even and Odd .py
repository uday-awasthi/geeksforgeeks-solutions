## DESCIPTION 
Given a positive integer x. Your task is to check, if it is even or odd (Any number that gives zero as remainder when divided by 2 is an even number).
Note: Return "Even" if the number is even; otherwise, return "Odd".

Examples

Input: x = 4
Output: Even

## SOLUTION 
# @param x: int
# @return: string

def checkOddEven(x):
    # code here
    if x%2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"
